Hi, I'm Chenyu Lin. ‘Yu’ doesn’t exist in English pronunciation—if you’d like to try, it’s similar to the German /ü/ or French /ɥ/. I usually go by Cheney, which is easier to pronounce in English and still close to my original name.

Currently, I am a doctoral student in the Learning Sciences program within the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, advised by [Dr. Icy Zhang](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/zhang-icy/). Prior to joining UW–Madison, I earned a Master of Science in Games for Learning from New York University and had seven years of experience as a K–12 English teacher in China.

My research broadly focuses on embodied cognition in the context of AI–human interaction. In my free time, he loves snowboarding, sailing, outdoor sports, playing digital games and cooking.
